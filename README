============================================ [Introduction]

C99 is an algorithm for dividing a text document into a
list of coherent topic segments. Details of the algorithm
can be found in the "doc" directory.

If you use C99 for your work and got papers published,
please include the following citation :

Choi, Freddy (Forthcoming) "Advances in domain independent
linear text segmentation". Paper submitted to NAACL'00.

=================================================== [Usage]

"x" is an argument

C99 --help					Display help
C99 -n "n" < "doc" > "out"	Segment "doc" (n segments)
C99	< "doc" > "out"			Segment "doc"

"doc" is a list of sentences. Each line is a sequence of
space separated tokens.
